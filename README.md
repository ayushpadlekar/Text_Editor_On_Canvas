> [!NOTE]
> *- This app was made as an assignment for an insternship. </br> - The main challenge of the assignment was : to make the Text stay inside of the square canvas. It should not go outside the boundary whenever we drag or move the text.* </br>

> <ins><b> How I solved this challenge</b></ins> :- </br>
> <p> - I understood the problem carefully and analyzed what we have & what can be done. </br>
> - As we know, the square canvas have it's own coordinates (starting from 0,0 in the top-left). And the text has its co-ordinates position upon that canvas. When we drag the text, the touch-pointer-gesture assigns new X & Y co-ordinates to the text constantly. </br>
> 
> ‚Ä¢ So, I used my logic & applied constraints on each boundary sides of the square canvas that : </br>
> &nbsp; - if new-coordinates of text try to go outside the square boundary coordinates, then new-coordinates = boundary coordinates. </br>
> &nbsp; - which means the new-coordinates cannot go beyond the boundary-coordinates. </br>
> - Example code snippet :
> <pre>
>   if (new-coordinate < boundary-coordinate) {
>       new-coordinate = boundary-coordinate
>   }
> </pre> </p>
